# Water Ecoacoustics

A sound synthesis project built from raw water recordings.

Water Ecoacoustics explores how natural aquatic sounds — flowing streams, droplets, submerged textures, resonance, and turbulence — can be transformed into playable synthesis material. Instead of generating sound from oscillators alone, this project treats recorded water as the primary sound source and reshapes it into instruments.

## Concept

Water is not background noise.  
It is texture, rhythm, modulation, and harmonic material.

This project uses raw environmental recordings and processes them into:

- Pads
- Drones
- Percussive textures
- Granular atmospheres
- Synth-like tonal material

The goal is to blur the line between field recording and synthesis.

## Features

- Raw water recordings as primary audio source
- Granular processing
- Time-stretching and pitch manipulation
- Spectral shaping and filtering
- Resonance extraction
- Modulation-based transformation

## Signal Flow

1. Field Recording (stream / drip / underwater capture)
2. Pre-processing (EQ, noise isolation, normalization)
3. Granular or spectral manipulation
4. Modulation (LFOs, envelopes, randomization)
5. Output as playable synth textures

## Tools

Depending on version:

- TouchDesigner
- Pure Data
- Max/MSP
- DAW-based processing
- Custom audio chains

---

## Why Water?

Water has:

- Broadband noise characteristics
- Transient micro-events
- Natural rhythmic irregularity
- Subtle harmonic resonance

These qualities make it an ideal raw material for synthesis when reshaped through granular and spectral techniques.

## Future Directions

- Build a playable instrument interface
- MIDI-mappable parameter system
- Live performance version
- Sample pack export
- Multi-layer aquatic synth library
